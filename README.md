## About

This is my custom fork for Erick's gesture recognition on real time.

This is the examples shown in my live screen about [Recognizing gestures in real time right from the browser (pt-br)](https://www.youtube.com/live/MeS6dX2a2zQ?feature=share)

## Complete source code
- Access it in [app](https://github.com/syntune/live-recognizing-multiple-gestures-tensorflowjs/tree/main/recorded)
- Checkout the [live demo](https://syntune.github.io/live-recognizing-multiple-gestures-tensorflowjs/recorded). 
  - It recognizes, single hand gestures 🖐,👊,✌️,👍🏻 and the multigesture 🙅


## Have fun!
